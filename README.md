# ImageAnalysis

This repository contains code used in analyzing fluorescence microscopy images of neurons with HCR dots,
including segmentations of cells and dot calling.

This code is a personal library and has not been optimized for readability in any way.
However, it is important for scientific reproduciblity to make code public, so I have uploaded it here. 

The library is contained within the `ImageAnalysis.hpp` file. For example usage, check out `example.cpp`.
